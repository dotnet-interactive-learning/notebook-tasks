## Getting Started
After you have completed the prerequisites, it is now time to become familiar with the format of .NET Interactive Notebooks. We will first examine a premade notebook. To do this:

1. Copy the following link and paste it into a new browser tab. This link will open the notebook in **Visual Studio Code**.

> `vscode://ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode/openNotebook?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet-interactive-learning/notebook-tasks/main/EducatorTask1/GuideToUsingNotebooks.dib`

> Note: Visual Studio Code might ask you "Allow an extension to open this URI?" Click "Open."

> Note: Opening your first notebook on this machine might take a couple of minutes.

Now you should be able to see the notebook. See image below.

## Creating a Lesson in .NET Interactive Notebooks
You will now use your own course material to create a notebook. To begin, we will create a blank notebook:

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` to open the command palette. 
3. In the search bar, type in `.NET Interactive: Create new blank notebook`. Press `Enter` to execute the command. 
4. Select `Create as .dib`. 
5. Select `C#` as the default language. A new, blank notebook should appear.

Using the reference guide, take some time to create an interactive lesson.
